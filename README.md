# Ehayes Portfolio

This is a portfolio showing my skills in creating web pages using java/html/css/javascript. Three main projects are a Barbershop website where you can book an appointment, a password generator, and a reddit clone. 
## Getting Started
This will be up as a website hosted on github when completed and you can try out the websites. 
### Built With 
Spring FrameWork and Maven
